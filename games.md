[Fix-it Felix](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/fix-it-felix/)
------------

I ported this game to FirefoxOS during my time at Hitpoint
Studios. Originally it was written in Unity (C#) for iOS and
android. Since FirefoxOS does not support unity,
I rewrote the game in Javascript using ImpactJS. The result
is a slimed down version of the game that loads faster and
works on low end devices.

Hallow's Hunted
---------------
I worked with a team of two other programmers and one artist to develop this
game in 48-hours. It won 1st place in the gamejam during which it was
developed. I wrote the turret AI and pathfinding.

Innocent
--------

A little twin stick shooter written in C++ using the Cinder library.
I worked on this with one other programmer, and artist, and a composer.
I wrote the core of the game engine including the rendering code and the
game object system.
