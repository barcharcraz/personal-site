# [Nim](nim-lang.org)

I have various contributions to the nim language and community, both
in the form of some bugfixes to the compiler itself and in the form of libraries
and wrappers. Nim is a fairly new systems programming language that aims to be
reasonably fast while also being much safer and more pleasant than C.


[Direct 3D support](https://bitbucket.org/barcharcraz/directnimrod)

I authored and currently maintain Nim's wrappers for Direct 3D and its
associated libraries, including Direct2D, DXGI. The wrappers currently support
Direct3D 11, 11.1, 12 and 12.1

[vecmath](https://github.com/barcharcraz/vecmath)

My own personal vector math and linear algebra library for Nim
supports vectors and matrices of various sizes and types. It also has support
for some miscellaneous things such as Quaternions and axis aligned bounding boxes.
In general I add features as I need them.

### Wrappers

In addition I maintain wrappers for the following libraries:

* assimp
* libpng
* alpm
* FreeImage
